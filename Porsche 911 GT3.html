    <h3>Porsche 911 GT3</h3>
    
<ul>
<li>
	It’s not every day that a new Porsche 911 GT3 hits the road, but 2021 saw just such an occasion as the German marque launched its 503bhp track-ready monster.
</li>
<li>
    	Powered by a rear-mounted 4.0-litre flat-six engine, the GT3 will hit 0-62mph in 3.4 seconds en route to a top speed of 198mph. It’s not the absolute fastest 911 - that’s the GT2 RS with the Weissach package - but it’s deeply impressive on road and track.
</li>
<li>
    	While the GT2 RS will lighten your bank account by over £200,000, the GT3 is a comparative bargain at £128,000. It’s good value compared to its main rivals, too, but prices will remain high as demand will undoubtedly be higher than supply.
</li>
<li>
    	Superb damping means that the ride is brilliant, and it provides a stable platform that allows you the driver to exploit the huge performance provided by the engine.
</li>
<li> 
	No wonder it lapped the Nurburgring in under seven minutes (a whole 17 seconds quicker than the previous GT3).
</li>
</ul>
